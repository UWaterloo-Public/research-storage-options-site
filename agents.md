# AI Agents for Research Storage Options Platform

This document outlines potential AI agents that could enhance the University of Waterloo Research Storage Options platform, providing intelligent assistance for researchers seeking appropriate data storage solutions.

## Overview

The Research Storage Options platform currently uses rule-based filtering to help researchers find suitable storage solutions. AI agents could provide more sophisticated assistance, personalized recommendations, and proactive guidance throughout the research data lifecycle.

## Proposed AI Agents

### 1. Storage Recommendation Agent

**Purpose**: Provide intelligent, context-aware storage recommendations beyond simple rule-based filtering.

**Capabilities**:
- Analyze research project descriptions to infer storage requirements
- Consider historical usage patterns and researcher preferences
- Suggest optimal combinations of storage solutions for different data types
- Provide confidence scores for recommendations

**Implementation Approach**:
- Natural language processing for project description analysis
- Machine learning model trained on successful storage decisions
- Integration with existing CSV data structure
- Fallback to current rule-based system

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: "I'm working on a longitudinal health study with 500 participants over 3 years"
Agent: "Based on your study design, I recommend:
1. HealthCloud Storage (95% confidence) - optimized for health research compliance
2. UW Dataverse (90% confidence) - for data sharing and preservation
3. OneDrive (85% confidence) - for day-to-day collaboration"
```

### 2. Compliance Advisory Agent

**Purpose**: Provide real-time guidance on data governance, privacy, and regulatory compliance.

**Capabilities**:
- Assess data sensitivity and recommend appropriate risk classifications
- Flag potential compliance issues based on research domain
- Suggest data handling best practices
- Monitor regulatory changes and update recommendations

**Integration Points**:
- Enhance the "research data risk classification" filtering
- Provide contextual help throughout the selection process
- Link to relevant UWaterloo policies and external regulations

**Example Interaction**:
```
User: Selects "Health" faculty and "Medium Risk" classification
Agent: "⚠️ Health research with medium risk data may require additional considerations:
- PIPEDA compliance for personal health information
- Consider encryption at rest and in transit
- Review REB requirements for data storage duration"
```

### 3. Cost Optimization Agent

**Purpose**: Help researchers optimize storage costs while meeting their technical and compliance requirements.

**Capabilities**:
- Calculate total cost of ownership for different storage options
- Suggest cost-effective combinations for multi-tier storage needs
- Recommend data lifecycle management strategies
- Alert users to funding opportunities or cost-saving programs

**Data Requirements**:
- Storage pricing information (could be added to CSV or separate data source)
- Usage patterns and access frequency analysis
- Integration with UWaterloo financial systems (future enhancement)

### 4. Migration Assistant Agent

**Purpose**: Guide researchers through storage migration processes and transitions.

**Capabilities**:
- Assess current storage setup and migration complexity
- Generate step-by-step migration plans
- Identify potential data integrity risks
- Coordinate with IT support services

**Workflow Integration**:
- Trigger when users change storage requirements
- Provide downloadable migration checklists
- Schedule follow-up consultations with IT support

### 5. Research Data Lifecycle Agent

**Purpose**: Provide guidance throughout the entire research data lifecycle, from collection to preservation.

**Capabilities**:
- Map storage needs to different research phases
- Suggest data organization and naming conventions
- Recommend backup and preservation strategies
- Provide reminders for data review and cleanup

**Lifecycle Stages**:
- Planning and collection
- Active analysis
- Collaboration and sharing
- Long-term preservation
- Disposal or archiving

### Data Integration

**Current Data Sources**:
- `storage2.csv` - Storage options and capabilities matrix
- University policy documents
- Faculty-specific requirements

**Additional Data Needs**:
- Pricing information
- Usage analytics
- Compliance frameworks
- Historical decision data

### Progressive Enhancement

**Phase 1: Rule Enhancement**
- Add intelligent tooltips and contextual help
- Implement smart defaults based on user selections
